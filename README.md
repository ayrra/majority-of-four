# majority-of-four
A java socket program that implements a majority of four algorithm. There is a client and a server to this program. The server is always started first, this will accept client connections on its serversocket. It will run a loop that will generate an array of 8 booleans to simulate a byte. This one array will be duplicated 4 times and stored in separate arrays. Next the original simulated byte will be displayed. After we will introduce errors to the 4 duplicated boolean arrays. They will be packed and displayed so we know what we are sending, they will then be send to the client.
The client will receive these 4 packed bytes where they be stored into a integer array where they are secondly packed into a byte array. Majority will be performed on the byte array and will give us the index of each majority b. This integer if -1 will flag as unknowable, otherwise it can then be turned into a byte, where we can unpack it into 0’s and 1’s and it will output the final correct answer. Once that is complete the client will send a shutdown signal to the server.
